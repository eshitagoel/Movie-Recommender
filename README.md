# ST449 - Artificial Intelligence: Project (MT2021)

### Overall objective

This project is intended to i) assess your overall knowledge related to Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically the concepts and techniques discussed during our lectures and seminars, ii) give you the opportunity to design an AI application on a topic/scenario of your choice, and iii) allow you to work as a data science team.

### Instructions

1. **GROUPS**: This is a workgroup project. As such, the group is expected to design a solid solution for a particular application or scenario. Everyone in the group is expected to engage and contribute to the final solution.

**Forming groups**: if you need to find someone else to form a group with you, check our [Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cgDiCNOS11FqQo8HwfnrwNgyFDLTUlaOh4Wixrf4hyc/edit?usp=sharing) and contact your prospective teammates. **Groups ideally consist of and are limited to 3 students**.

2. **TOPIC**: Choose a topic or scenario for which you want to design an AI application. **See the References section for some ideas**. Make sure to identify good research questions and/or contributions that you can address with your project. You can i) reproduce a given study/application, based on a set of research papers, and add your own contributions and findings, ii) design an AI-based application for a particular problem and compare your approach to existing approaches for solving this problem, iii) make a comparative analysis of different AI approaches (e.g. single/multi-agent systems, supervised learning agents, reinforcement learning agents, propositional logic agents, Bayesian networks etc) for you chosen topic/scenario, or iv) propose and justify your topic and then design and validate your AI-based approach.  

3. **DATA**: Make sure you can identify a consistent set of **real data** to use in your application. You can also **generate synthetic data** in case you don't find real data. Also, you can **use any existing dataset(s)** and **import these data into your application**. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the data and that the data is of good quality/completeness. **No need for playing with big/huge data or complex environments**, but **make sure you have a good amount of data that allows your agent(s) to train, test and validate hypotheses, or make consistent inference** to solve the problem.

4. **MODELLING**: Make sure your model is consistent and close to the real world scenario you chose. When specifying any environments, be clear in terms of states, actions, and rewards (if any) you are considering in your model. The same applies to any conditional probabilities. Also, clear state any restrictions and/or application rules that your solution must comply with.

5. **ANALYTICAL METHODS** You are free to choose any AI-based approach (or more than one) to solve the proposed problem. Clear justify your choices based on i) the suitability of the chosen method(s) w.r.t. to the problem, ii) the data and the knowledge you have about the problem, iii) the research questions/hypotheses and expected outcomes, and iv) technical complexity and other issues related to the design of your solution (this comprises how easy/hard is to deploy the proposed approach).

6. **AI TECHNOLOGY**: Feel free to play with any existing software and/or library. **There is no expectation** that you will design a complete, new approach; but that you can show a good understanding and mastery of the techniques and tools you chose. This comprises a consistent set of parameters, exploration of alternatives leading to your choices, a proper set of validation/evaluation metrics, followed by a discussion of the observed results. It is important to you to set **to what extent the chosen technology has helped you in solving the proposed problem**.

### Deliverables

Your **solution** `MUST` contain:

* a PDF document with i) LSE candidate numbers (LSE student IDs are fine in case you don't have your candidate numbers, but **don't put your names**), ii) description of the chosen topic/scenario and research questions/hypotheses (based on item 2 above), iii) description of your data (based on item 3 above), iv) justification of the technology/tool (item 6), v) the outputs of your modelling step (item 4), and vi) textual description of your analytical approach with a consistent rationale and justification of all your choices. Reports should be written in [JMLR style](./JMLR_without_decorations.zip) and are restricted to **9 content pages** (including figures and tables), followed by arbitrary number of pages containing references.

* any code file designed in your project.

* any dataset or synthetic data used in your project.

### Important dates

* Assignment released: 13/12/2021
* Submission of group/topic information: 17/12/2021, 6 pm (London)
* Submission of solution: 21/01/2022, 6 pm (London)
* Feedback and grade (provisional): 25/02/2022, 10 pm (London)

### Marking criteria

* This assignment is worth 80% of the final grade.
* **IMPORTANT**: according to the School policy, you **must** submit an answer to this assignment; otherwise, you will be graded 0 (zero).

| Problem breakdown  | Max marks |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| (2) Topic/scenario - relevance and complexity of the topic/scenario in terms of states, actions, rewards, constraints, conditional probabilities, inference rules or any other characteristics that apply to your project. Clear description of the topic/scenario.  | 15 |
| (3) Data - data consistency and quality. Usage of real data and any criteria for subsampling. Generation of synthetic data and how it mimics a real scenario. Good description of the data. Amount of data available versus research questions, inference scenarios, or any other aspects that help to measure how adequate the data were for the proposed problem. Data preparation tasks. | 10 |
| (4) Modelling - model clarity and consistency (how close to the real scenario it is). Complete description of all elements of your model (states, actions, rewards, constraints, inference rules etc). | 10 |
| (5) Analytical models - clear justification and rationale of your analytical approach for the proposed problem. Complexity in terms of existing code/functions you were able to use versus code/functions you had to design. Correct use of the proposed models in terms of (only those aspects applying to your project) parameters, training/testing steps, probabilities, rules etc.  | 15 |
| (6) Results and discussion - clear and consistent discussion of your results. This should be related to your initial research questions/hypotheses and the options you were able to test based on the data you have used. Novelty and contributions of your project, compared to existing approaches to solve the problem, identified gaps, and/or outstanding results. | 30  |
| (7) Technology - justification, adherence, and technical complexity involved in its use. | 10 |
| Documentation - quality of the PDF report, code organisation and documentation. | 10 |
| TOTAL  | 100  |
